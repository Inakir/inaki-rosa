This will run in Safari on Mac. It may run on Microsoft Edge, I'm not sure.

If you can't get it to run right, see the video included in project directory.

In order to properly run this simulation you need to change the -allow-file-access-from-files flag in chrome.
You do this by opening up the command window (On windows) and typing "C:\the path to chrome\chrome.exe" -allow-file-access-from-files
After that, you can simply double click on the cannonTest.html to run the simulation.
